## Introduction

I was provided with a design mockup and replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website using Bootstrap that displays images, descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects I completed throughout the course of my Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree program.

## Contributing

This repository is the author's code for a project of Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree.
